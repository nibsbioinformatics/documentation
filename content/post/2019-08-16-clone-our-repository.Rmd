In order to clone our repository, open a terminal and type

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/nibsbioinformatics/core.git
```

This will create a new folder called **core** which contains all our code.

Refere to the specific pages for instructions on how to implement the different elements of our pipeline.
